In the Users Dashboard, As you can see we have "Expert Network", "Career Guide", "Career Roadmap". So we need to make it dynamic instead of dummy data. So what we will do is, we will use both the admin dashbaord and this to make it dynamic,
1. so the base thing is the admin can add and remove profiles for Expert network, and the users can browse through the profiles in the network and check thier information.
2. In Career Guide, the user will chat, and after chat based on the result of the chat we will show various Career Roles such as Android Developer, Web Develoepr, Web3 Developer etc etc, these all can be added from admin dashboard.
3. In Career Roadmap, based on the selected Career in the Career guide the roadmap will be shown to use and it will be tracked. Use the existing career roadmap strucutre which is occupied with static dummy data, use the same stucutre and make it in admin dashboard such that the admin can add all that information for each Career.

So the User will first come to career guide, choose the career and then navigates to career roadmaps and begins the progress of completing the roadmap.

Make a comprehensive plan, make a md file for the plan and keep completing and updating the tasks.
